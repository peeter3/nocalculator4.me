# Abacus lessons

This a script for an abacus instructor to use with his or her class.

## This is a soroban.

There are many different kinds of abacuses. The Chinese abacus is called _suan pan_. <sup>[<a name="id0002" href="#ftn.id0002">§</a>]</sup> The Japanese abacus is called _soroban_. It has four beads on the bottom and one on the top.

## Clear the abacus

The abacus consists of a frame, bar in the middle, and beads that slide on rods.

**<center>How many rods are on the abacus? Count them.</center>**

A small abacus may have 13 rods.

**<center>How many beads are on each rod? Count them.</center>**

There are five.

**<center>Pick any one of the rods. How many beads are below the bar?</center>**

There are four.

**<center>The bottom beads are called _1‑beads_.</center>**

**<center>How many beads are above the bar?</center>**

There is one.

**<center>The top beads are called _5‑beads_.</center>**

**<center>If the beads touch the bar in the middle, count them. If the beads do not touch the bar, they do not count.</center>**

_Clearing the abacus_ means pushing all the beads away from the bar:

1. Hold the abacus straight up and down so that all the beads to down; then set it flat on the table.
1. Move all the top beads away from the bar. Move your right pointer (index) finger along the bar from left to right so that all the top beads pop away from the bar.

Some abacuses have a button to push that clears the abacus. If your abacus has such a button, do this:

1. Set your abacus flat on the table.
1. Squeeze the button.

Now all the beads are away from the bar; the abacus is _cleared_.

**<center>When the abacus is cleared, what number is that? Zero.</center>**

**<center>Now, with the thumb of your right hand, slide a 1‑bead up to the middle. What is the number? 1.</center>**

* Now slide up another 1‑bead. 2.
* Another bead. 3.
* Another bead. 4.

**<center>Now, with the index finger of your right hand, slide the 5‑bead down to the middle. Without lifting that finger, slide over the middle bar and push the four 1‑beads away from the middle. What is the number? 5.</center>**

**<center>Now, with the thumb of your right hand, slide a 1‑bead up to the middle. What is the number? 6.</center>**

* Now slide up another 1‑bead. 7.
* Another bead. 8.
* Another bead. 9.

## Count on the abacus

You work on the abacus using the thumb and pointer finger of your right hand.

These are the rules of finger motion when counting up and down on an abacus:

> (1) Use your thumb _only_ to move 1‑beads up. Use your index finger for all other bead motion.  
> (2) In quick succession, first move down a 5‑bead, and then move down one or more 1‑beads.

### Count from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd>

Now count from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd>. Now to count from <kbd>9</kbd> to <kbd>10</kbd>, you need two more rules of finger motion:

> (3) First move down one or more 1‑beads, and then, if necessary, move up a 5‑bead.  
> (4) In addition, after finishing work on the units‑rod, move up a 1‑bead on the tens‑rod.

The rod you were adding on from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd> is called the _units‑rod_ or _ones‑rod_. _[Solicit]_

* Anyone want to guess what the rod to the left of it is called? The _tens‑rod_.
* Anyone want to guess what the rod to the left of the _tens‑rod_ is called? The _hundreds‑rod_.

### Count from <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>100</kbd>

### Count down from <kbd>100</kbd> to <kbd>1</kbd>.

### Count _by tenths_ from <kbd>0.1</kbd> to <kbd>2.0</kbd>

Go back to the ones‑rod.

* Anyone want to guess what the rod to the right of it is called? The _tenths‑rod_. If you're counting money, this is where you count your dimes.
* Anyone want to guess what the rod to the right of the _tenths‑rod_ is called? The _hundredths‑rod_. If you're counting money, this is where you count your pennies.

### Count down by tenths from <kbd>2.0</kbd> to <kbd>0.1</kbd>.

### Your fingers should dance on the beads

With practice, your pointer finger and thumb should move quick and light on the beads. Never press down on the beads—just touch them lightly, move them, and then get off of them.

**<center>Keep your fingers close, never far away from the beads.</center>**

## Set numbers on the abacus

Set these numbers on your abacus:

* <kbd>2</kbd>
* <kbd>7</kbd>
* <kbd>12</kbd>
* <kbd>55</kbd>
* <kbd>4.1</kbd> (This is the same as <kbd>$4.10</kbd>.)
* <kbd>82.99</kbd> (This is the same as <kbd>$82.99</kbd>.)
* <kbd>100.01</kbd> (This is the same as <kbd>$100.01</kbd>.)
* <kbd>291.47</kbd> (This is the same as <kbd>$291.47</kbd>.)

## Arithmetic on the abacus

You can just keep counting beads to get our answer.

### 5 & 10 memory game

There's a faster way to add and subtract numbers of the abacus. Learn the facts of 5 and 10. You can learn these facts by playing the _5 & 10 memory game_!

#### Facts for 5

Think of the number five. This is your principal number. Now choose a number between zero and five, inclusive. Suppose you thought of the number three. The complement is that number that you add to three to get five. The fives-complement of three is two. Say the following out loud:

1. “Three plus two is five.” (3 + 2 = 5)
2. “Two plus three is five.” (2 + 3 = 5)
3. “Three is five minus two.” (3 = 5 − 2)
4. “Minus three is two minus five.” (−3 = 2 − 5)
5. “Two is five minus three.” (2 = 5 − 3)
6. “Minus two is three minus five.” (−2 = 3 − 5)

Statements 3‑6 must be stated exactly in the way prescribed above because they follow the thinking and finger motion used while adding or subtracting on the abacus. It is true to say, for example, “Two minus five is minus three.” or “Minus three is minus five plus two.”, but neither helps you master calculating on the abacus.

#### Facts for 10

Think of the number ten. This is your principal number. Now choose of a number between zero and ten, inclusive. Suppose you thought of the number four. The tens-complement of four is six. Say the following out loud:

1. “Four plus six is ten.” (4 + 6 = 10)
2. “Six plus four is ten.” (6 + 4 = 10)
3. “Four is minus six plus ten.” (4 = −6 + 10)
4. “Minus four is minus ten plus six.” (−4 = −10 + 6)
5. “Six is minus four plus ten.” (6 = −4 + 10)
6. “Minus six is minus ten plus four.” (−6 = −10 + 4)

For the same reason described previously, Statements 3‑6 must be stated exactly in the way prescribed above.

#### A simple rule

**<center>For the facts for 5, after “is,” always say the positive number first. For the facts for 10, after “is,” always say the negative number first.</center>**
### Multiplication

Know your multiplication facts from 1 × 1 to 9 × 9. Practice them on the abacus:

1. Count by ones to 9. Count back down.
1. Count by twos to 18. Count back down. …

## FAQ

### What are the red beads for?

On some abacuses, there are rods whose topmost 1‑beads are red while the other three beads are black. These beads mark special rods; let us call these the “red rods.”

You will notice that these red rods occur on every third rod. They are convenient for setting and reading long numbers, like a comma.

<table>
<tr>
<th>With commas</th><th>With red rods</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>10<span class=h>.0</span></kbd></td><td align=right><kbd>1<font color=red>0</font><span class=h>0</span></kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>710<span class=h>.0</span></kbd></td><td align=right><kbd>71<font color=red>0</font><span class=h>0</span></kbd></td>

<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>98,710<span class=h>.0</span></kbd></td><td align=right><kbd>9<font color=red>8</font>71<font color=red>0</font><span class=h>0</span></kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>498,710<span class=h>.0</span></kbd></td><td align=right><kbd>49<font color=red>8</font>71<font color=red>0</font><span class=h>0</span></kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>3,498,710<span class=h>.0</span></kbd></td><td align=right><kbd><font color=red>3</font>49<font color=red>8</font>71<font color=red>0</font><span class=h>0</span></kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=right><kbd>3,498,710.6</kbd></td><td align=right><kbd><font color=red>3</font>49<font color=red>8</font>71<font color=red>0</font>6</kbd></td>
</tr>
</table>

You can see that for convenience, when possible, it is good to choose a red rod to be your ones‑rod. Again, it is not always possible to make the ones‑rod a red rod, but many times it is. When your units‑rod is a red rod, then think of the comma being between the red rod and the next rod on the right. In the case of the red rod which is the ones‑rod, think of the _decimal point_, not the comma, being between the red rod and the next rod on the right. This helps you properly set and read long numbers.

### Can I use my left hand instead of my right hand?

Yes, but then in order to use the same finger motion, you should set your numbers _backwards_. The rod to the right of the ones‑rod is the _tens‑rod_, and the rod to the left of the ones‑rod is the _tenths‑rod_. If you want to use your left hand, go ahead; do everything backward and do not forget to read your numbers backward as well.
